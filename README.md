# go-api
A simple api written in Go.

# Setup
Put this folder in your $GOPATH and run `go get` to get all the dependencies then run `./serve.sh` a script located in this repository to build and run the code

# Mock data
`main.go` contains some mock data to test with, modify it directly in the code as needed.

# Port
By default the api starts on port `8000`, modify that in `main.go`

# Postman Collection
Import the `postman_collection.json` into your postman app to get a quick start with calling different endpoints
